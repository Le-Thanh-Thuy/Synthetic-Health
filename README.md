# Content
- Analyzed synthetic health data using **R** and **`tidyverse`**, performed data cleaning.
- Developed multiple **linear regression models** with **interaction terms** *(e.g., smoking $\times$ diet/sleep)*, achieving **adjusted $R^2$ = 0.84**.
- Improved model performance using **cubic B-splines** for non-linear features, boosting adjusted $R^2$ to \**0.87** and lowering **AIC** from 5826 to 5701.
- Applied **bootstrap inference** (1000 iterations) to assess coefficient stability and construct **95% prediction intervals** for health score estimation.
